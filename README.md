# KMeans_Clustering_UsingGEE

This repository contains the application of a simple unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-means) for clustering using the Python API of Google Earth Engine.

For the report and explanation of step-by-step process we took to complete the project, please refer to **Assignment_report.ipynb**. This file contains the explanation of steps we have taken to find and visualize the clusters of the given data. The results are also presented in that file.

The code implementation and additional results can be found in **Assignment_Script.ipynb**. This file contains the full code used for training, clustering, comparing, and creating the visualizations.
