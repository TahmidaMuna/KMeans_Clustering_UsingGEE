# KMeans_Clustering_UsingGEE

This repository contains the application of a simple unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-means) for clustering using the Python API of Google Earth Engine.

For the report and explanation of step-by-step process we took to complete the project, please refer to **Assignment_report.ipynb**. This file contains the explanation of steps we have taken to find and visualize the clusters of the given data. The results are also presented in that file.

The code implementation and additional results can be found in **Assignment_Script.ipynb**. This file contains the full code used for training, clustering, comparing, and creating the visualizations.

# Task Overview 
In this excercise, our task is to perform K-means clustering algorithm for Landuse clustering in two different countries using the Sentinel 2 imagery and functionalities of Google earth Engine.
Discussion Point -
* Why do we need to train an Unsupervised Classifier in GEE?
* Impact of Number of Cluster in the result
* Impact of performing Cluster in different Region
* Computational Time

# Datasets and File Description
